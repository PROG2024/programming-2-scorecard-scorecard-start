"""
This code contains common errors that can by detected 
by static type checking -- if the type is known!
Please do not fix this code by inspection.

Instead, add type hints and watch your IDE (or mypy) find errors.

Add these hints ONE AT A TIME.  SAVE the file after each one and run mypy.
Observe how the type hint helps it perform static checking.

1) add type to parameter:                `add_score(self, score: float)`
2) add type to return value of average:  `average(self) -> ???`
3) add type to self.scores attribute:    `self.scores: ???[???] = []`
4) add type hints for all parameters and return values.
   If a function does not return a value, don't write a type hint.
5) add type to the `suffixes` variable in `ordinal()` function. 
   Include the type of keys and values.
